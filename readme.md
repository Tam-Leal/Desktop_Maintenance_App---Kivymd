The Project
-



The idea of this project is that the employees of a company can make maintenance requests when necessary.
In addition, they can follow the progress of calls within a screen called "Queue".

Each user registers with their name, email and company sector.
From there, it can execute a call and be recognized in the request queue.

The maintenance team can access this list and schedule the execution of each request.
